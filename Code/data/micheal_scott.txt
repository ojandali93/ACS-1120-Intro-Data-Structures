you've been in the business twelve years 
Can you tell us how to manage a team how
to keep them happy as well as moving
towards the goal posts But they don't 
That's the tragedy 
This is the accounting department The
number dudes Don't let the job
descriptions fool ya They are all
completely crazy 
Especially that one He's a mental
patient Not literally of course that
wouldn't work The last place you'd want
someone like that is in accounting 
 Veddy interesting But shtoopid 
Artie Johnson I do that to cheer 'em

plants You know it makes them a little
bit happier because they can sometimes
get a little

Bigmouth ' Take it out of petty cash 
You can't put a price on comedy 
Cartoons Does my butt look big in

Ooh careful watch out for this guy 
Dwight Schrute in the building 
Ryan the new temp 
Introduce yourself 
Assistant to the Regional Manager 
Dwight's my right hand man immediately
beneath me as the priest said to the
altar boy Bill Maher Not his line 
but in the style of 
Of course there's nothing wrong with
that if you're gay I mean not that
I'm asking I'm not allowed to ask if
you're gay or Catholic And if you're
Catholic well it's actually word for
word a Bill Maher line so don't blame
me Over here is the kitchen 
We provide tea bags sugar stirrers 
creamer the works Oh coffee tax I
collect a coffee tax to pay for better
coffee Starbucks man Only the 'Bucks
will do So How 'bout fifty cents to

examine the jewels every month but this
felt different Turns out it's fine 
But freaky man testicular cancer 
 cancer of them old testicles 
Oh See you later 

Okay thanks for coming in This'll
only take a minute I am aware of the
rumors that have been circulating and I
just want to take this opportunity to set
the record straight 
Yeah I'm telling everyone now Dwight 
You don't know what it is 
I don't need your permission 
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to
enforce an ultimatum upon me and Jan is
talking about either downsizing the
Stamford branch or this branch 
No Stanley you didn't see me in there
with her 
For his eyes only 
I said If Corporate wants to come
here and interfere they've got to go
through me You can go and mess with
Josh's people but I'm the head of this
family You ain't messin' with my
chillun I am if any one's going to 
Not gunna happen 
It won't be out of my hands Stanley 
okay That's· a promise 
Well 
I have promised it okay and it's an
insult to me that you still have to ask 
Sorry Stanley Pam wants to speak 
Your turn Pam 
Well if you were in the meeting with
Jan then maybe you should 
 stick to the ongoing confidentiality
agreement of meetings 
Look This is my ship and I am asking
you to trust me and you can't go wrong 
It is a question of trust Stanley 
Yeah yeah it is a question of trust 
Do you trust me Do you trust me Yes
or no 
He does So meeting adjourned 
You don't have to 
Put your hand down 
Assistant to the Regional Manager

know means they let me get away with
murder you know the girls love me

Why Theft Stealing

joke him and me Morale boost 
Settling him in

Really Didn't know that 
What is the single most important thing
for a company Is it the building Is
it the inventory Is it the cashflow 
Nuh uh It's the people My proudest
moment here wasn't when I increased
profits by seventeen per cent or cut
expenses without losing a single
employee No 
It was a young Guatemalan guy first job
in the country barely spoke English but
he came to me and he went Mr Scott 
will you be the Godfather to my child 
He nods smugly Beat 
Didn't happen in the end We had to let
him go he sucked
